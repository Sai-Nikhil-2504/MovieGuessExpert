# MovieGuessExpert
This is a Python project that implements an expert system for guessing films. Users select a subgenre and respond to yes-or-no questions, and the system endeavors to guess the film title within a maximum of 7 questions. This project is designed to enhance skills in the application of branching control structures for cinematic classification
